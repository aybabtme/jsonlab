# JsonLab

CLI tool to deal with all things JSON.

# Install

I'd recommend you to build this from source. It's easy if you have Go
installed:

```
go get
```

Otherwise, you can use the following links to a build service:

* [Windows](http://gobuild.io/github.com/aybabtme/jsonlab/master/windows/amd64)
* [Linux](http://gobuild.io/github.com/aybabtme/jsonlab/master/linux/amd64)
* [OS X](http://gobuild.io/github.com/aybabtme/jsonlab/master/darwin/amd64)
