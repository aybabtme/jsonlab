# JsonLab

CLI tool to deal with all things JSON.

## Install

I'd recommend you to build this from source. It's easy if you have Go
installed and `$GOCODE/bin` in your `$PATH`:

```
go get github.com/aybabtme/jsonlab
```

## Download

You can use the following links to a build service. I don't know the authors
or if the binaries should be trusted.
